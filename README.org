* Webpaste.el -- Paste text to pastebin-like services
This mode allows to paste whole buffers or parts of buffers to
pastebin-like services. It supports more than one service and will
failover if one service fails. More services can easily be added
over time and prefered services can easily be configured.

** Installation
*** The lazy way (Using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]])
This requires that you have [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] set up. But it's in my opinion the
easiest way to install and configure packages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package webpaste
    :ensure t
    :bind (("C-c C-p C-b" . webpaste-paste-buffer)
           ("C-c C-p C-r" . webpaste-paste-region)))
#+END_SRC
